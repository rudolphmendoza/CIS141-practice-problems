# 1. Create a program that prints the following output to the screen: "Water. Earth. Fire. Air. Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony. Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked."
print("Water. Earth. Fire. Air. Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony. Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked.")
# 2. Create a program that prompts for 2 numbers and then outputs the addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of the first number by the second number.
num1 = int(input("Give me one number: "))
num2 = int(input("Give me another number: "))
print(num1, " + ", num2, " = ", num1+num2)

print(num1, " x ", num2, " = ", num1*num2)
print(num1, " รท ", num2, " = ", num1/num2)
# 3. Create a program that prompts for the side lengths of a triangle and computes the area using Heron's formula. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heron%27s_formula)

area = (math.sqrt(semip * (semip - len1) * (semip - len2) * (semip - len3)))

# 4. Create a program that computes different statistics given five numbers including the total, average, minimum, maximum, range, and standard deviation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation).
stat1 = int(input("Give me the 1st number: "))
